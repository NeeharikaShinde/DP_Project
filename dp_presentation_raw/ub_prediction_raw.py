#let me give you an example, how you can use the above data types to identify a users behavious 
#from the account information, we can see the age of the user. let the age be 15( a kid who is probably in school). 
#we can determine the role of the user from age and income or cedit score of the credit card from the billling details. 
#if he is a kid, and the location is from India, we can cross check with calendar 
#to know of it a holiday or working day for the schools. from that we can determine he skipped school or not to play the game. 
#if he  is playing in the school time, he is more addicted to the game. 
#from the log time we can see at what timings he is playing the game. 
#if he is playing late nights he is more addicted to the game. 
#from the communication if he is using the communication channel to chat other things rather than the game with his friends, 
#he is more addicted to the game.
#from all this predictions we can say he might be  willing to pay for the items in-game 
#if he is that addicted to the game and he is going to continue the game more longer.

#Based on the provided scenario, we can create a simple model to predict if a user is addicted to the game 
#and whether they are likely to make in-game purchases. 

#Here is an example using Python and the pandas library:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime

# Load the synthetic dataset (replace this with your own dataset file)
data = pd.read_csv("synthetic_dataset.csv")

# Define a function to determine if a date is a holiday in India
def is_holiday(date_str):
    # Define a list of holiday dates (you can extend this list)
    holidays = ['2023-01-26', '2023-08-15', '2023-10-02']
    return date_str in holidays

# Process the dataset to extract relevant features
data['Is_Kid'] = data['Age'] <= 15
data['India_Location'] = data['Location'] == 'India'
data['Is_Holiday'] = data['Date'].apply(is_holiday)
data['School_Time'] = data['Log_Time'].apply(lambda x: 8 <= int(x[:2]) <= 15)
data['Playing_During_School'] = data['Is_Kid'] & data['India_Location'] & ~data['Is_Holiday'] & data['School_Time']

data['Late_Night_Playing'] = data['Log_Time'].apply(lambda x: int(x[:2]) >= 22)

data['Non_Game_Communication'] = data['Communication_Data'].apply(lambda x: 'non-game-related' in x.lower())

# Define a threshold for each feature to consider the user as addicted
playing_during_school_threshold = 0.5
late_night_playing_threshold = 0.5
non_game_communication_threshold = 0.5

# Calculate the proportion of addicted behavior for each feature
data['Playing_During_School_Proportion'] = data['Playing_During_School'].sum() / len(data)
data['Late_Night_Playing_Proportion'] = data['Late_Night_Playing'].sum() / len(data)
data['Non_Game_Communication_Proportion'] = data['Non_Game_Communication'].sum() / len(data)

# Determine if a user is addicted based on the thresholds
data['Addicted'] = (
    (data['Playing_During_School_Proportion'] > playing_during_school_threshold) &
    (data['Late_Night_Playing_Proportion'] > late_night_playing_threshold) &
    (data['Non_Game_Communication_Proportion'] > non_game_communication_threshold)
)

# Determine the likelihood of making in-game purchases based on the user being addicted
data['Likely_To_Purchase'] = data['Addicted']

# Save the dataset with the new features and predictions
data.to_csv("synthetic_dataset_with_predictions.csv", index=False)


#This code calculates the proportion of addicted behavior for each feature and determines 
# if a user is addicted based on the provided thresholds. If a user is considered addicted, 
# the model predicts that they are likely to make in-game purchases.

#Please note that this is a simple example, and you should tailor the code to fit your specific dataset and use case. 
# You may also want to consider using more advanced machine learning techniques for a more accurate prediction model.
